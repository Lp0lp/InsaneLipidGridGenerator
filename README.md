# InsaneLipidGridGenerator

Welcome to the Insane Lipid Grid Generator!

This should help you define the initial lipid grid input used by insane & COBY to create lipid membranes.

### Quickstart guide:
1) Define your lipid resname on the right.
2) Bead by bead, following the order in your itp file, input your bead name and place it as you believe them to roughly be.
3) Tap 'Save points' to get your output. This should be pasted in your insane.py script. [COBY]() input formats are also available, albeit needing a bit of manual adjustment to bead charges."

Note: Remember that in CG resolution this process only needs to be roughly accurate. Typical location depths of the POPC headgroup, phosphodiester (PO4), lipid glycerol and acyl-chains are displayed. Beads can be moved by dragging. If you make a mistake you can delete a bead by right clicking.
